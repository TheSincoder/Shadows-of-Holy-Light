### Text Based RPG

#### To use this repo after cloning:

#### The Goal
I want to build a text based rpg for the table top game I've been developing for
the last 3 years. 

#### Elements

Accounts that can have multiple characters. These will be saved in a Postgresql database.
A storyline for the character to play through with multiple choices impacting the story and ending.
An in game shop that will allow the character to purchase and sell items which will impact their game play.
Meaningful combat with a dice mechanic. Combat should be obvious to player.

#### Notes to help me in development

email api

need auth.py
api routes
database models

character interaction could work in both  react and the python api
best to handle all with react

save progress - game has a state
save all variables in a JSON and save to LS take it back out (Don't next JSONs)

Build out Home Page

#### Problems and How I solved them

##### Missing script: "start"
Had two my folder in a folder. Had to delete all the installs out of the outer folder and open 
VSC in the inner folder

##### Music
Spent about 4 hours on it. Tried using the useSound documentation. Built in hook 'isPlaying' wasn't working. Used useState to set isPlaying and it worked!
Spent another two hours on looping the music, had to use Howler.js. Looping the music broke the
stop function. Had to call Howler.stop() instead of gameMusic.stop() and that worked!

##### Radio Buttons
After trying to use formik for about 4 hours, I reached out to Kevin for help. Kevin turned me to
use Radio buttons straight from MUI and use it within the form like we did in class. (Why I didn't do that at the beginning the world may never know). After about 2 hours I had it figured out and it works!

##### Connecting Front End to Back End
Had to add Token to database in order to call it and use it.
